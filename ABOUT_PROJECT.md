# About Sparkler WebApp

This project is a website that help mobile gamers to buy a royal pass and diamonds (games like Freefire, Pubg, Fortnite..)

## How clients use this Website? 

In home page the client will choose which game he want to boost then he enter his game ID 2 times to confirm, and number of diamonds he need to buy (the price will automatically calculate and display in the bottom). He will add a picture to proof that he send neccesery money to admin of site. Then he send the request (If there are some problems like wrong ID error messages will display).

## How admin can follow and manage requests ?

If admin want to connect to his dashboard he need to create in adressBar of the navigator "http://...sparkler/login" then he enter his email and password and connect.

In admin cpanel page (http://...sparkler/cpanel) the admin can see and manage all requests (he can finish or delete request).
He can see the status of all requests (which is finished, which is not finished),
finished requests will display in the bottom of table and their color red. Requests not finished (in examination) will display on the top of table and color green.

Also admin can change the email adress and password to login to cpanel .. 

If someone create in adressBar of the navigator "http://...sparkler/cpanel" if his not connected he will be redirect to login page.
If admin is already connected and he create in adressBar of the navigator "http://...sparkler/login" he will be redirect to cpanel page because he is connected.
